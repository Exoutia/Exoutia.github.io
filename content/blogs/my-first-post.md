Hello my name is Bibek Jha and this is my first blog. I have made this using *Hugo* a great framework for generating static sites.
If I have time I will create a tutorial on how to create your own persnal blog and host it on *Github-Pages* like this. 

Today I want to write about something that I have experienced while just living in this world. I will call this journey, the journey where I got lost, hurt and at the end found myself. 

## Journey

I am not really a travellor I have never been to some foreign country or even outside of my hometwon myself alone, so I can't really have experienced journey in physical sense. My life is journey itself its a journey of finding myself. 
From the time I can remember
