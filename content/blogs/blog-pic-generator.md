# Blog Pic Generator
If you read my blogs about solving question you will see a similar pic for my blog at top of my page. This pic is generated using a web-application that I have made using Python.

## Technologies
I have made this web application using Python framework <mark>Flask</mark>, and <mark>Jinja</mark> templates. 

## How Does this work.
In this application I have made a form that will take the information that I want to show in the picture and optionaly a picture. When everything is filled up, the app will generate a html page with the information correctly rendered. After this I just take the screenshot and insert into my blog.

The backend is made using <mark>Flask</mark> which store and handle all the information that I send to the application and rendering is done using dynamic web template that I created using <mark>Jinja</mark> with <mark>html-css</mark>.
