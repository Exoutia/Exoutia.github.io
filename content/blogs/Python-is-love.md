Today I am going to talk about Python language. If you follow me you will know that I really love this language from web development to solving dsa problems. It is my first real language that I learned on my own (my first programming language is c but I just copied code from friend to pass the class in university). From the moment I started learning I am in love with this language, I know it has some problems like it is somewhat slow compared to other compiled language and etc but let me tell you for sure if you can do python there is far more plus than downside. 

To mention some:

 **Simplicity in Syntax:**
 Python's syntax is so clear and straightforward that it feels like poetry. Its simplicity allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than wrestling with complex code structures. We'll delve into how Python's readability makes it a language that you can easily fall in love with.

 **Versatility and Flexibility:**
 Python is a polyglot, seamlessly integrating with other languages. Whether you're building web applications, conducting data analysis, or diving into artificial intelligence, Python is your versatile companion. We'll explore the vast domains where Python's flexibility shines, making it a language you can rely on for all your coding endeavors.

 **A Thriving Ecosystem:**
 The Python ecosystem is a flourishing garden of libraries, frameworks, and tools. From Django for web development to TensorFlow for machine learning, Python provides a rich collection of resources. Join us as we stroll through this lush ecosystem and discover the treasures that make Python truly lovable.

 **Community and Collaboration:**
 Love thrives in a community, and Python boasts one of the most vibrant and welcoming communities in the programming world. We'll discuss how the Python community's collaborative spirit fosters learning, sharing, and supporting one another.

 **Readability and PEP 8:**
 Python's commitment to code readability is encapsulated in the PEP 8 style guide. We'll explore how adhering to these guidelines not only makes your code beautiful but also creates a shared aesthetic that unites Python enthusiasts around the globe.

 **Beginner-Friendly Nature:**
 Python is often the first programming language for many beginners, and there's a reason for that. Its gentle learning curve and extensive documentation make it an ideal language for those taking their first steps into the world of programming. Join us as we reminisce about our own first encounters with Python.

 **Innovation and Trends:**
  Python isn't just a language of the past; it's continually evolving and adapting to the latest trends in technology. We'll explore how Python remains at the forefront of innovation, from web development frameworks to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## To Get Started
In my last blog I talked about starting to learn data science and right now to get started with data science one should know some tools that are used in market right and these includes **Excel**, **Python**, **SQL** and etc. So this week I am going to publish my articles on Python language and its important features. Honestly there are many free resources on learning python and honestly they are great you can follow some of them if you want to but I learned best by doing myself so whatever you learn try to code them yourself and experiment with them.

Few I would point out:
1. [RealPython](https://realpython.com/)
2. [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
3. [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) (Most Important resource and honestly everyone should read it if they are working with python. It is very well written)

I will publish more blogs on topics ranging from Beginner to Advanced concepts in hope to help someone out there who may have same problem which i talk in these.
