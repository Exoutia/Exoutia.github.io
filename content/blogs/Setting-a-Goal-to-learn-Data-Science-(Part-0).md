I have always been interested in Data and how one can gleam so many interesting information about the thing that data is about. My college this semester is teaching Big Data so I wanted to learn data science in side with my college studies. Now's the best time to learn about this. 

While learning I will try to take notes according to a book I am reading on building second brain and publish a weekly blog about the things I have learned that week.

I will follow this guide provided by [CodeBasics](https://codebasics.io/resources/data-science-roadmap-2024). This is a good guide which focus both on soft skills and hard skill with real time frame with exercise to follow through. I will try to maintain the schedule and become a great at Data Science.

I will add my experience while learning them and also note down any problem that I encountered and how I solved those problems so that someone can get help from these blogs.

Thats all from my side hope to meet you guys again on my next blog, until then bye ðŸ˜‰.
