      <description>I have always been interested in Data and how one can gleam so many interesting information about the thing that data is about. My college this semester is teaching Big Data so I wanted to learn data science in side with my college studies. Now&amp;rsquo;s the best time to learn about this.&#xA;While learning I will try to take notes according to a book I am reading on building second brain and publish a weekly blog about the things I have learned that week.</description>
