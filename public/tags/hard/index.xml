      <description>The link to problem is Leetcode/find-median-from-data-stream&#xA;This is hard problem but it is somewhat easy compared to some other hard problems. It is only easy if you know data-structures well enough. In this problem you are asked to create class which has two methods one for adding a integer, other function is used to get median in the ordered list made up of elements added previously in the list.&#xA;Heapqueue Approach Now this problem is hard cause we have to get median in O(1) constant complexity.</description>
