      <description>Today I am going to talk about Python language. If you follow me you will know that I really love this language from web development to solving dsa problems. It is my first real language that I learned on my own (my first programming language is c but I just copied code from friend to pass the class in university). From the moment I started learning I am in love with this language, I know it has some problems like it is somewhat slow compared to other compiled language and etc but let me tell you for sure if you can do python there is far more plus than downside.</description>

      <description>I have always been interested in Data and how one can gleam so many interesting information about the thing that data is about. My college this semester is teaching Big Data so I wanted to learn data science in side with my college studies. Now&amp;rsquo;s the best time to learn about this.&#xA;While learning I will try to take notes according to a book I am reading on building second brain and publish a weekly blog about the things I have learned that week.</description>

      <description>The link to problem: leetcode/n-queens&#xA;The problem is very famous for practicing backtracking, in this problem the questioneer is asking how to arrange n number of queens in a nxn matrix. Now if you think this can be done using backtracking where we place a queen at every position and check if the position is correct and we able to place n queens in the board then return the board with those postions.</description>

      <description>Blog Pic Generator If you read my blogs about solving question you will see a similar pic for my blog at top of my page. This pic is generated using a web-application that I have made using Python.&#xA;Technologies I have made this web application using Python framework Flask, and Jinja templates.&#xA;How Does this work. In this application I have made a form that will take the information that I want to show in the picture and optionaly a picture.</description>

      <description>Today I solved this leetcode problem leetcode/subsets-ii, before solving this question one should solve the leetcode/subset.&#xA;Backtracking In this problem we need to find the powerset of the list of number given. The catch is that the list of numbers can contain the duplicates but the ans set shouldn&amp;rsquo;t contain any duplicates. To solve the problem we can use backtrackint where at every step we either include the number or not.</description>

      <title>Find Median From Data Stream</title>

      <description>The link to problem is Leetcode/find-median-from-data-stream&#xA;This is hard problem but it is somewhat easy compared to some other hard problems. It is only easy if you know data-structures well enough. In this problem you are asked to create class which has two methods one for adding a integer, other function is used to get median in the ordered list made up of elements added previously in the list.&#xA;Heapqueue Approach Now this problem is hard cause we have to get median in O(1) constant complexity.</description>

      <description>The link to question is lettcode/design-twitter.&#xA;The question is asking us to design a simple twitter like class. It has four functions: - To create a post. - To follow another user. - To unfollow any user. - To get newsfeed which comprises of ten recent post from the people user is following and himself.&#xA;This question is somewhat advanced level to solve it one should already be adept in other datastructures like array and have some idea about sorting.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to solve this leetcod/task-scheduler. This is a good problem and would need some thinking to solve it thorughly.&#xA;Heapqueue Approach In the question one had to find the least time a computer would take to complete some tasks, while completing task computer has to take some time before it can do the same task again so either do another task or do nothing for that unit of time.</description>

      <title>Kth Largest Element in Array</title>

      <description>Today we are going to solve this leetcode problem. In this problem we are required to find the kth largest element in an array of number.&#xA;Intutive Approach This is pretty easy sum if we just sort the array and the return the kth largest element from the array. In python this is pretty easy problme cause in python list can be quried with negative number to return the elements from the end of arrray.</description>

      <title>K Closest Points to Origin</title>
      <link>https://Exoutia.github.io/blogs/k-closest-points-to-origin/</link>

      <guid>https://Exoutia.github.io/blogs/k-closest-points-to-origin/</guid>
      <description>Today we discusses the solution to the LeetCode problem of finding the Kth closest points to the origin.&#xA;Intuitive Approach An intuitive solution involves calculating the distance of each point from the origin, storing it with the point, and then sorting the list of points based on these distances. The Kth closest point is then retrieved from the sorted list.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s the Python code for the intuitive approach:&#xA;from math import sqrt class Solution: def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -&amp;gt; List[List[int]]: val = [] for i in points: x = i[0] y = i[1] val.</description>

      <description>Link to the question: LeetCode/Last-stone-weight&#xA;In this problem, you are given an array of integers representing the weights of stones. The goal is to simulate a game where, at each turn, the two heaviest stones are selected and either both are destroyed (if they have the same weight) or the lighter stone is destroyed, and the heavier one&amp;rsquo;s weight is updated. The process repeats until there is at most one stone left, and you need to return the weight of the last remaining stone or 0 if there are no stones left.</description>

      <title>Kth Largest Element In a Stream</title>

      <guid>https://Exoutia.github.io/blogs/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/</guid>
      <description>This is a simple software design problem in LeetCode. So according to problem we have to create a datastruccture which will return the kth_largest element every time we add element in this datastructure.&#xA;Intutive Approach This soltuion can be pretty intutive just insert the new element and sort the list in reverse order and return the array the K index element.&#xA;The code would look like this:&#xA;class kthLargest: def __init__(self, k: int, nums: list[int]): self.</description>
